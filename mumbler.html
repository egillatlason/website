				<h3>The Mumbler</h3>
				<p>For whatever reason, some children obtain a disposition that doesn’t allow for a lot of human interactions. At least that’s what Ian told Henry’s parents. Henry Vogler’s disposition had manifested itself in such a way as to make him mumble every syllable. That is not to say that he wouldn’t talk to people. He could make himself fairly understood with a combination of mumbles and hand gestures, but his speech itself was entirely incoherent. When he turned thirteen, his parents finally admitted that the problem wasn’t going to solve itself, and hired Ian the speech therapist to work with Henry over summer break.</p>
				<p>“Could you tell me anything about Henry that I might use to get his attention?” Ian said.</p>
				<p>“He spends most of his time at home in our library. He doesn’t care about the colour television, but he loves books,” Mr. Vogler said. “I don’t know if he understands what he reads, but you might start with that.”</p>
				<p>It turned out that Henry wouldn’t talk (or mumble) to his therapist at all. He thought Ian was pretentious. The only times Henry reacted at all was when his mother came into the living room to bring him pastries. His favourite was the Berliner, which, if one was less than discreet, one could have likened to Henry. Ian forbade the rotund pastries until Henry would cooperate. This did not make Henry any more appreciative of Ian, but it did work.</p>
				<p>Ian came every weekday and sat with Henry for three hours. During their sessions they would each sit on a Chesterfield sofa, facing each other. Ian would read a passage from one of the books in the Voglers’ living room bookcase – which wasn’t as large as the ones in the library, but it was respectable – and Henry would repeat it. Ian tried to appeal to Henry with the likes of Romeo and Juliet or the Brownings, but Henry liked Titus Andronicus better. In time, Henry became articulate; in fact, during that summer, his enunciation became coloured by that elusive character of the greatest public speakers: that particular range of baritone, coupled with an intonation that falls effortlessly in line with people’s expectations. At the end of the summer, stepping out of their door, Ian pronounced to the Voglers that Henry would be “the most popular kid in class, solely because of his voice.”</p>
				<p>But on the first day of school, Henry didn’t make much use of his voice. As usual, he sat in the back of the classroom and didn’t speak unless spoken to. When no one in class knew the definition of tyranny, the teacher jokingly tried her luck with Henry. Everyone was aghast not only that he answered the question, but at the eloquence of his answer: “Tyranny is any callous, senseless, or arbitrary use of power.”</p>
				<p>The impact of this became evident during recess, when a number of the children crowded him, each talking over the other: “You can talk now? Guys, the mumbler can talk. How did you know that answer? Have you always been smart?”</p>
				<p>Henry couldn’t shake them. “You imbeciles have no idea how smart I am, and it would take me hours to explain. Now leave me alone.”</p>
				<p>One of the larger kids, the sort that nature seems to place outside of convenience stores, overheard Henry’s retort. In the silent schoolyard, this kid did not condescend to speak to Henry. Rather, he stood in front of him, looked him in the eye, and punched him in the gut. Henry collapsed on the ground, and the kid stood over him while everyone dispersed. From there, Henry was alone. He was alone when the school bell rang, and he was alone when he finally staggered away.</p>
				<p>He did not return to class, nor did he go home. He went to the bakery. He had a habit of going there after school, where he provided the staff with magnificent displays of gluttony. They were always delighted to have him. Besides having a liberal allowance, he was easy to please – just give him whatever he pointed at. When he entered, all three staff-members (and both of the customers) turned. It was early enough so that every pastry was trying to outdo the others in terms of fragrance. Behind the battleground of pastries stood the head baker, a stout woman who always put her hands on her hips before talking.</p>
				<p>“Why aren’t you at school?”</p>
				<p>Henry all but ignored her, and plumped his finger on the glass. “Can I have the biggest, fattest Berliner? The one that looks like you.” He held his finger on the glass, as everyone went silent.</p>
				<p>The head baker lifted her hands from her sides and placed them on the display counter. “What did you just say to me?”</p>
				<p>He lowered his finger. What was wrong? This was how he always ordered Berliners. Why was she not wrapping up his Berliner? “I ordered a pastry,” he said.</p>
				<p>“You aren’t getting anything until you learn to shut your goddamn mouth.”</p>
				<p>Henry’s face impersonated an Edvard Munch painting – you know which one. He looked around for help, but everyone was mimicking his expression. He turned and walked out of the store. From there he went no more than ten meters before dropping onto a bench.</p>
				<p>What had happened? He was aware that most people disliked him, but they never punched him or threw him out of stores. It wasn’t as if he had changed, really; he had said the same sort of things as every other day. Was it how he said it? Was there something in his manner or tone that displeased people? It must be. There must be some antagonizing quality to his voice, or else they were jealous. Ian said they would like his voice, so they must be jealous. Either way, he had a solution – he would stop speaking.</p>
				<p>Henry’s resolve delighted him. He jumped off the bench and imitated zipping his mouth shut. From now on he would have to act out everything, so there could be no sparing the theatrics. He did his best silly walk on the way home, where he would spread the moving leg outward, dangle it a little, and plonk it on the ground. Everyone who passed him smiled, and some even did their own funny walk. Once he stopped talking people were fond of him, even more so than when he had mumbled.</p>
				<p>Once he reached his house, he condescended to walk normally up the stairs leading to the front door. The air inside was overbearing. The door made a flump sound as it closed. Henry’s father was slouched over a typewriter in the living room.</p>
				<p>“You should be at school.”</p>
				<p>Henry was silent.</p>
				<p>“Why don’t you answer me?”</p>
				<p>Henry mimed zipping his mouth.</p>
				<p>“Oh great, you’ve stopped talking. After all the trouble we’ve gone through with Ian. You know, we damn near give you anything you could want, and this is what we get in return: a fucking mime.”</p>
				<p>Henry looked down at his foot, which was drawing lines on the floor. Mr. Vogler’s continued displacements brought Henry’s mother in from the kitchen. In between yelling at his father, she offered Henry all sorts of remedies: a G.I. Joe figure, pastries, love. Henry was silent. It seemed his resolve hadn’t changed anything here. They kept arguing, and it was a while before his father addressed him.</p>
				<p>“If you are so determined to disobey us at every turn, and not make anything of yourself, then why don’t you just leave?”</p>
				<p>He was on to the next pathology immediately, but the idea struck Henry. He could just leave. He turned from his parents, and climbed the stairs to the sound of “Where do you think you’re going?” and, “Oh, let him go.” Once in his room, he packed a leather duffle bag. He owned a suitcase, but he thought the duffle bag was more appropriate. He was sensible enough to pack a set of clothes, nonsensical enough to pack a couple of books, and greedy to pack a day old pastry. He figured he would go to the city. He had heard people were less engaging there; you could walk through the whole thing and no one would so much as greet you. You were meant to be silent.</p>
				<p>He walked downstairs and looked at his parents. Where anyone else would have said his goodbyes, Henry just waved. They didn’t notice. He started walking silly as soon as he was outside.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>II</p>
				<p>Henry knocked on the door of the farm and took one step back. He stood between two Doric pilasters holding the outlines of a pediment; the building was a white behemoth with a black roof. So, the main building wasn’t necessarily very farm like, but the rest of them were; red barns and weathered cottages. There was a garden behind the main building whose trees reached far above it; the garden was separated from farmland by a hedge.</p>
				<p>It probably hadn’t been a good idea to walk to the city.</p>
				<p>The door opened to a man wearing a white t-shirt and dirty overalls, large enough to fill the entire doorway. Henry could have sworn the man’s hands left a mark on the door-handle. Neither of them said anything until Henry coughed and kicked his duffle bag lightly towards the open door.</p>
				<p>“Hello,” the man said.</p>
				<p>Henry lowered his head and cast his eyes up towards the stranger in a begging motion, but the man just lowered his brows in response.</p>
				<p>“What do you want?” the man said.</p>
				<p>Henry clasped his hands together in a begging motion.</p>
				<p>“Are you looking for work?”</p>
				<p>Henry shook his head violently.</p>
				<p>The man kicked the duffle bag towards Henry. “We aren’t taking freeloaders. We do have room for another farmhand.”</p>
				<p>Henry looked towards the now dimly lit road, but he couldn’t see another house in either direction. He nodded his head reluctantly, picked up his duffle bag, and tried to shuffle past the man, who stopped Henry and almost crushed his hand.</p>
				<p>“The name’s Mr. Smith. You must be starving.”</p>
				<p>Mr. Smith guided Henry by putting his hand around him, effectively funnelling Henry into the kitchen. After feeding him some reheated casserole in the kitchen, Mr. Smith showed Henry into the worker’s sleeping quarters. It was one of the red cottages, situated on the left side of the main building. Inside were seven beds all stacked up to one wall, and at the opposite wall was a trunk for each bed.  On the far end was a sink and mirror. The duffle bag went in the trunk and Henry fell asleep instantly.</p>
				<p>He woke up to an empty cottage.</p>
				<p>The first thing he did was wash his face, which was quite the task since he couldn’t see his reflection properly in the dirty mirror. Then he opened his duffle bag. The last pastry was so stale he had confused it with his books while rummaging through the bag; only for emergencies, he thought. As he sat down to read, a bell rang in the main building. Must be lunch time. But when he stepped out of the cottage everyone was walking towards him. The workers, all of whom were at or around his age, walked past him to the field, but his landlord came towards him.</p>
				<p>“Look who slept in. You missed lunch.”</p>
				<p>Henry shrugged his shoulders, even though he was hungry.</p>
				<p>“I figure if you work for a week you’ll have paid off your lodging and training. And if you work for a month I’ll pay you.”</p>
				<p>Mr. Smith led Henry to the fields where another kid was charged with training him. The kid must have been only a couple of years older than Henry, but he was much taller and broader, and seemed perfectly at ease, even though he had a twenty-kilo bag of fertilizer slung over one shoulder. He gave Henry a pat on the shoulder and said, “Hey there, I’m Sikes. Is Mr. Smith giving you any grief?” Henry shook his head and got to work. He never imagined potato farming would be fun, but he didn’t realize he’d be bad at it. It was simple in principle: plough this, pick that, move this here, shovel, sweat. But he was slow to it, and it would be generous to say that he did half the work of anyone else.</p>
				<p>At the end of the day they all shuffled into the dining room in the main building, where his mentor sat next to him. Mr. Smith gave everyone two scoops of goulash, but when he came to Henry he looked him up and down and gave him one scoop and left the room.</p>
				<p>Sikes snagged Henry’s bread. “So he is giving you grief.”</p>
				<p>When they got back to their cottage, Henry found that his bed was on the other the side of the wall from everyone else’s. He wouldn’t have had the energy to move it back, even if he had the guts. Henry had never been so hungry in his life, and when the other boys had fallen asleep he ate his last pastry.</p>
				<p>The next day Henry woke up with everyone else. This earned him three half-meals. After work, in the cottage, all the other boys were horsing around as Henry tried to read in his bed. They called each other dope, or kike, or fag, as they felt appropriate. They pushed each other, jumped between the beds, and periodically they ganged up on no one in particular, just to see if he could stand it.</p>
				<p>Henry had read the same page three times when Sikes walked up to him and said, “What do we call this one?”</p>
				<p>“The Monk,” said someone smaller than Sikes. “Because he doesn’t talk.”</p>
				<p>“That’s good,” said Sikes, “because he doesn’t do much either.”</p>
				<p>Henry burrowed his head into his book and accidentally mumbled, “At least I know how to read, you damn imbeciles.”</p>
				<p>Everyone took a step back and mouthed an “Ohhh.”</p>
				<p>Sikes was the first to say anything. “So, you can talk. I mean you can mumble at least… You’re a mumbler.” He turned around and threw his hands in the air. “That’s what we’ll call him: the mumbler.”</p>
				<p>Henry threw down his book and stormed out. They called after him, “The mumbler, look at the mumbler go.” He ran straight forward, through an opening in the hedge and before he knew it he was in the garden behind the main building. Vines of wisteria surrounded the path and occasionally stroked his face as he went farther into the garden. The birch trees reached high in the air, creating domes here and there. Eventually he got to a little island surrounded by orchids, in the middle of which was a statue.</p>
				<p>He couldn’t hear the boys anymore and allowed himself to look at the statue. It was of a mostly naked guy grabbing a mostly naked girl; although, it looked like he was running, so maybe he was chasing her. She was doing something else entirely. She was throwing her hands in the air, but her fingers were twigs and so was part of her hair. The whole thing was strange, but he couldn’t look away.</p>
				<p>As Henry admired the statue, a figure appeared on the balcony. She was around his age, wearing a purple shift dress. She stroked the edges of a handheld mirror with a metallic garland. Henry walked closer, half hidden by the wisteria. She was like the moon, or maybe the sun. However beautiful girls were usually thought of, she was exactly that. He wished he could be her mirror. She lifted her eyes from her reflection and sighed. Henry stepped into view, hoping she would see him, hoping she would speak. He stepped on a twig as he moved.</p>
				<p>“Hello?” she said, “is someone there? Where are you? Hello.”</p>
				<p>It must have been too dark for her to spot him. He would have to speak, even though it meant breaking his resolve. He didn’t have a problem breaking his resolve for her. As for what to say, it just came to him.</p>
				<p>“I am called Henry, but if that name does not please you I will be whatever –”</p>
				<p>“You’re kind of fat.”</p>
				<p>“Uh, I swear by the moon –"</p>
				<p>She brought the mirror to her face and walked inside the house. “Whatever.”</p>
				<p>Henry stood still for a long moment. He must have done something wrong. This wasn’t how it had happened in the stories. He curled himself into a ball of sorts, and walked back to the cottage in that fashion. He didn’t hear the other boys as they eventually left him alone.</p>
				<h4>* * *</h4>
				<p>Henry came back every day to woo her in grand paraphrased soliloquies. He told her how he loved her and then he counted the ways: I love you in the breadth times length times height, where my soul can reach, though sometimes out of sight. I love you freely, purely, and with passion put to use. I stand in my old briefs, I wear with childhood faith. I love you with blood and sweat and tears, and if alright by God I’ll love you though you’re dead.</p>
				<p>She always showed him that same dismissive attitude. After a week he gave up and grew despondent. He never improved his work but contented himself with his half-meals instead; sometimes he wouldn’t finish those either. He never moved his bed, and he didn’t talk to anyone. When he got his half-pay, he stowed it in his duffle bag, and when the other boys went into town to spend theirs, he stayed behind. When he had gotten one full pay check, he did the same. After work, he read in a nook in the garden – a nook where he couldn’t see that damn statue.</p>
				<p>He thought about leaving. In fact, he had been planning to leave for a while, but the thought of her stopped him. Soon, he thought, as he slid past the Ionic column holding the balcony and happened to see her. She was standing next to the path, admiring a single branch of wisteria, and when he tried to sneak past her, she called out to him, “Hi there.”</p>
				<p>He turned towards her, shoulders stooped, eyes down. “Hi.”</p>
				<p>“Are you one of the new workers? You all seem to come and go so fast.”</p>
				<p>She didn’t recognise him. He dared to look at her and noticed that she didn’t look at him the same way – that is to say, as if he was really standing somewhere further back. Now her look was a little downward and a little forward at the same time. Henry was baffled. He looked himself over for the first time in two months and found that he had lost his flab. He was slim going on toned, if a little emaciated – though neither of them noticed that.</p>
				<p>“I’m Rarity,” she said. “What’s your name? Are you really working here?”</p>
				<p>“Henry, and yes I –”</p>
				<p>“You talk funny.”</p>
				<p>Henry stopped in his tracks.</p>
				<p>With a smile on her face, she took him by his sweaty hand and led him through the sitting room, the grand foyer, up the grand staircase, and into her room. “Well, you don’t have to work anymore. You can sleep in one of the guest rooms and you can hang out with me. Put this on, won’t you?” She handed him a two-button single-breasted suit, with an orchid boutonniere.</p>
				<p>“I guess I have been wearing the same outfit for a while.”</p>
				<p>“We can go shopping in the city, and take pictures, and…”</p>
				<p>Henry went behind a screen to change. “I’ve always wanted to go to the city,” he said.</p>
				<p>“…we can eat good food and go dancing.” When Henry presented himself, Rarity unbuttoned his lower button and handed him her mirror. “Hold this, will you?”</p>
				<p>She sat on a mountain of pillows propped up against the headboard, while he sat on the far end of the bed, pointing the mirror at her.</p>
				<p>“How is my hair,” she said, “do you like my jewellery?”</p>
				<p>“You’re very pretty –”</p>
				<p>“I have a lot of jewellery. Daddy buys it for me.” She jumped out of the bed, got a jewellery box from her dresser, and sat down in the exact same spot, in the exact same pose. Then she tried on every single piece of jewellery in that box, recounting how she had gotten each one.</p>
				<p>“Daddy bought this one for my birthday. And this one I got on this boring family trip, I really had to work for it.”</p>
				<p>Henry had been estimating how long he would have to hold the mirror by counting the remaining pieces of jewellery, when she closed the box and got a new one. It was dark when she finished the second box, and Henry had two hands on the mirror.</p>
				<p> “I’m tired,” she said.</p>
				<p>“You’re tired? I’ve been holding this mirror for –”</p>
				<p>“You can go now. Just find one of the guest rooms and sleep in there.”</p>
				<p>Henry stomped out of the room and slammed the door behind him. Well, he sort of slammed it; it was hard enough to make a statement, probably – it was ambiguous. He considered slamming the door again, but decided not to. He was annoyed, but he couldn’t quite tell why. Was Rarity not as pretty as he had thought? No, she was pretty alright. He figured he would do as she said and figure it out later; then he could fix it. Maybe it was something about him. If it was something about him then Rarity could fix it.</p>
				<p>He started opening doors. Bathroom. Library. Study. Mr. Smith’s study – with Mr. Smith in it. He was hunched over the table, wearing a suit, dealing with some papers; but what struck Henry were his reading glasses. They seemed so out of place on Mr. Smith’s precipitous face that Henry burst out laughing the moment he walked in. Mr. Smith’s face became as if it was filled to the brim with some burning liquid. He marched to Henry, “So you can talk. Then you can tell me what you’re doing in my study, and what’s so goddamn funny.”</p>
				<p>Henry gathered himself mostly. “I was in your daughter’s room. And you look really stupid with glasses.”</p>
				<p>Henry stopped laughing when Mr. Smith grabbed him by the neck and dragged him outside. Henry was still struggling when they went down the stairs and Mr. Smith opened the door. By the time they were inside the workers quarters, Henry was limp. In one movement, with one hand on Henry’s neck, Mr. Smith threw the displaced bed into place, and chucked Henry’s duffle bag at him; he startled the entire workforce. Mr. Smith then took Henry outside, threw him into the Bentley, and tasked the butler to drive him to the bus station in town. Once there, Henry was encouraged to take the late bus to the city, and he did. It wasn’t until the bus had left that the butler noticed the missing posters with Henry’s face on it.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>III.</p>
				<p>The first thing Henry noticed about the city wasn’t the towering skyscrapers or the sea of people; it was the sounds. The conjoined rattle of footsteps, honking of horns, and revving of engines made the hubbub accompaniment to the talking. Henry hadn’t realized there would be so much talking. But, he was quick to note, that talking was reserved to the coffee shops, angry taxi drivers, or the stores – where only the teller and the customer would talk while the rest stood and waited. As long as he stuck to the sidewalk he was exempt from talking. In any case, he wasn’t particularly inclined to talking after his conversation with Mr. Smith.</p>
				<p>So, he walked. He walked past statues of great founders, great fountains, and the great powerhouses of artistic merit: opera houses, libraries, museums. He walked until his feet hurt and his stomach churned. Then he stood in that taciturn line, and when it was his turn, he pointed to the revolving pizza, laid the exact price on the table and ate.</p>
				<p>As he continued his tour of the city, the light shifted from a clear orange to an artificial yellowy white, projecting most distinctly onto the building at the end of the street: a hotel. The hotel was an ancient beige, with superfluous pilasters and flowery capitals. Henry walked through the lobby, up to the reception and pointed to the keys behind the receptionist, who wasn’t much older than Henry.</p>
				<p>“Hello sir,” the receptionist said.</p>
				<p>Henry laid a little money on the table.</p>
				<p>“Do you want a room? If so, I’m going to need your name.”</p>
				<p>Henry hesitated.</p>
				<p>“If you want the room you’re going to have to give me your name.”</p>
				<p>Henry looked around the room. It couldn’t lead to much harm if he spoke just once. “Henry.”</p>
				<p>The receptionist lifted his brows by instinct. “Ok.” His voice broke. “It’s – for the night and you’re in room number –.” He pushed a key along the table.</p>
				<p>Henry nodded, grabbed his key, and walked toward the elevator. As he waited for the elevator a man wearing green bell bottoms, an orange shirt, and a purple suit approached him.</p>
				<p>“You know I couldn’t help hearing you back there; the name was Henry was it? I’m Tom, and I’d love to hear more about you.”</p>
				<p>Henry pressed the elevator button one more time.</p>
				<p>“C’mon kid, why won’t you talk to me?”</p>
				<p>The elevator arrived and Henry got on. Tom did not follow, but he watched Henry until the door closed. Henry went to his room and fell asleep reading The Tables Turned.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, it seemed as if Tom lived in the reception, because every time Henry went in or out of the hotel, whether to read in the library, or eat pizza, Tom was there to meet him. He walked alongside Henry from the entrance to the elevator, all the while harassing him with questions. “What, are you a monk or something? That’s fly and all, but can’t you say something for me?” </p>
				<p>At the end of the week the receptionist called Henry over.</p>
				<p>“Hey kid, um, sir. I need to know if you’re gonna be staying any longer.”</p>
				<p>Henry sighed. Why wouldn’t they leave him alone? He stormed to the reception, head held low. With Tom at his heels, he decided on his next move because it was powerful and it would keep him from having to talk. He slammed all of his remaining money on the table and waited for his change.</p>
				<p>“This isn’t enough.”</p>
				<p>Henry gasped, despite himself. Tom sprung into laughter. The receptionist started coming up with solutions – “Do you have any more money? Is there anyone who can pay for you?” – But Henry just stood in place. He was shaking.</p>
				<p>Tom stopped laughing and said, “I’ll pay your tab if you just talk a little for me.”</p>
				<p>Henry broke. “Fine, what do you want me to say?”</p>
				<p>A couple of heads turned in the reception, and Tom turned a couple more when he started. “Yes, that’s it; that magnificent voice. Kid, I work for KGBE, the radio station. I’m going to make you a star.”</p>
				<p>Henry didn’t have a choice. “Ok.”</p>
				<p>“Great!” Tom put his hand around Henry and pulled him along. “You’ll love the radio host life. It’s a life of luxury. What do you like? Candy? You’ll be buying out candy stores in no time when you’re a radio host. Don’t worry about your stuff, we’ll send somebody for it.”</p>
				<p>Before Henry knew it he was sitting in a recording studio with a contract on his lap. He sat next to the glass separating him from the control room where Tom was arguing with his colleague Richard. There was a grand piano in the far corner which was easily ten meters away from him. Sheet music stands were scattered all over the place, and the ceiling, some thirty meters high, held tens of dangling lights. Henry could hear everything Tom and Richard said.</p>
				<p>“We just got a brand new eight track recorder and you want to do talk radio with a child?” Richard said.</p>
				<p>“I know it sounds crazy. But you should hear this kid talk, man. It’s far out.” Tom said.</p>
				<p>“That doesn’t mean he can conduct interviews.” </p>
				<p>“We can teach him, man.”</p>
				<p>“We don’t have the setup.”</p>
				<p>“Then we’ll get a table in here.” </p>
				<p>“We’d need to set up a profanity delay.”</p>
				<p>“No we don’t… like, what’s the worst thing he could say?”</p>
				<p>Tom went to turn on the PA, when he noticed it had been on all along. “Shit. Umm, hey kid, did you get a chance to look at the contract yet?”</p>
				<p>Henry had read two pages of the twenty-page contract and so far he had understood nothing. “Yes.”</p>
				<p>“That’s great. Are you ready to sign?”</p>
				<p>“Yes,” Henry said.</p>
				<p>Tom gave him a thumbs up behind the glass and the two men came into the recording room. Tom pulled a sheet music stand over, put the contract on it and handed Henry a wet fountain pen. “So, mostly we’re gonna need you to conduct a series of interviews. That doesn’t sound too hard, does it?”</p>
				<p>Henry shook his head. He signed in large, wobbly, capital letters. When he finished, Richard grabbed the contract and took it into the control room. Tom, in turn, handed Henry a little wad of cash. “That’s your allowance.” Henry put it into his pocket without counting it. He was happy to be back on an allowance.</p>
				<p>“Follow me,” Tom said.</p>
				<p>They went into the lobby where Tom opened the door to the left; it was one of two doors in the lobby – the other was marked “control room.” The door led them to a hallway. On the left was a single toilet, and at the end there was a narrow stairway. The stairway led them into a bright room, the size of the entire lower floor excepting the recording room. It was furnished with a bed, table, sofa, bookcase, excessively colourful rug, acoustic guitar, upright piano. There were two windows, one was plain and overlooked the recording room, and the other was a round stained glass window which almost filled the massive triangle that was the roof.</p>
				<p>“This is the old control room,” Tom said. “When we moved it, this became our party pad. You’ll be staying here.”</p>
				<p>Henry stared up at the stained glass window. There were figures in between the colours.</p>
				<p>“Oh yeah,” Tom said. “This used to be a church. They gave us a good price for it, too.”</p>
				<p>Henry sat down on the sofa and tested the springs a little. They were both silent. Tom looked around the room while nodding his head. He looked quite proud. Then he caught himself. “Oh, yeah, I have to get your stuff from the hotel. You just make yourself at home.”</p>
				<p>Henry lay down on the bed as soon as he left.</p>
				<p>When the light from the stained glass window woke Henry, the duffle bag was next to the stair. He walked straight downstairs to the recording room. Someone had set up a table with a microphone and a glass of water on each side; on one end was a couple of papers as well.</p>
				<p>“That’s your seat.”</p>
				<p>Henry turned to find Richard in the control room. </p>
				<p>“Tom isn’t in today.” Richard said. “He’s probably in some lobby talent scouting. I’m guessing that’s how he found you.”</p>
				<p>Henry nodded.</p>
				<p> “You could do with talking some more if you’re going to be a radio show host. You will be interviewing someone from city council today, his information is on those papers.”</p>
				<p>Henry sat down in his chair. The papers had two handwritings. One was in neat rows, while the other was all over the place and included arrows referencing the neat rows. So while the former said “Mr. Antolini works on city council alongside fifteen other representatives,” the latter interjected “typical pencil pusher.” Practically every other sentence had a comment. </p>
				<p>Henry finished reading the papers, and they did some mic tests. Before long there was a knock on the door. In came Tom and a man.</p>
				<p>Tom was pointing at the man. “Look who I found outside our door, it’s our esteemed guest, Mr. Antolini.” He turned toward Mr. Antolini and pointed at Henry. “This is the gentleman who will be interviewing you. Don’t let his appearance fool you, he’s a professional in every sense of the term.”</p>
				<p>Mr. Antolini put out his hand and Henry nodded in response.</p>
				<p>Tom said, “Have a seat Mr. Antolini.”</p>
				<p>“All right.” Mr. Antolini sat down while Tom went into the control room.</p>
				<p>After about a minute of tinkering, Tom started the broadcast. “Ladies and gentlemen, coming up is our brand new segment, the Golden voice, with your host, Henry. With him is our very own city councillor, Mr. Antolini.”</p>
				<p>The “on air” light turned on as Tom pointed at them. </p>
				<p>Mr. Antolini said, “Thank you so much for having me on.”</p>
				<p>Henry looked at his papers. “You work for city council alongside fifteen other representatives.”</p>
				<p>That’s right, we make all the important decisions concerning, for example, the water, or roads –”</p>
				<p>“I understand you also push pencils.” </p>
				<p>The on air light turned off for just a moment. In the control room, Tom and Richard were wrestling for the controls; Tom had a wide smile on his face.</p>
				<p>Mr. Antolini said, “We don’t do anything of the sort. Right now I’m trying to zone for offices.”</p>
				<p>“And how is that going to stop the war?”</p>
				<p>You could hear Tom laughing through the glass.</p>
				<p>Mr. Antolini’s face was red. “It has nothing to do with the war. It’s because the job market is changing.”</p>
				<p>“And why can’t you find anything good to do with your time?”</p>
				<p>The on air light turned off for good as Mr. Antolini rose from his seat. “That’s it. I won’t stand for this.” He stormed out into the lobby where Henry could hear Richard meeting him. As Richard was pleading with Mr. Antolini in the lobby, Tom came in to Henry, wiping a tear from his eye.</p>
				<p>“You know, those notes of mine, they were jokes. You weren’t meant to read them.”</p>
				<p>Henry gave such an earnest “oh” that Tom sprang back into laughter. When he had gathered himself he said, “But I’m glad you did.”</p>
				<p>Richard threw open the door. “Nice going, you two. You just ruined us.”</p>
				<p>Tom said, “Relax Dick, we aren’t ruined. We just have to coach Henry a little.”</p>
				<p>“Coach him a little? He’s absolutely lacking in human decency!”</p>
				<p>Tom smiled at Henry. “You take the rest of the day off while we discuss things.”</p>
				<p>Henry left without a word, and went to the library, where he sat until dark. When he came back there was a crowd outside the studio. They wore the strangest colourful clothes and they smelled. They didn’t bother Henry as he walked in to find Tom waiting for him.</p>
				<p>“Hippies, Henry. The hippies love you.”</p>
				<p>“Sorry?”</p>
				<p>“That voice always gets me; you should really talk more.” Tom caught himself. “Do you know what hippies mean, Henry?”</p>
				<p>Henry shook his head.</p>
				<p>“They mean we can say whatever the hell we want. We don’t have to coach you at all. As long as the hippies agree with you, you can be as rude as you want.”</p>
				<p>Henry smiled.</p>
				<p>“Do you want to meet your fans?”</p>
				<p>Tom chuckled awkwardly and led Henry upstairs. Then he made Henry stand right in front of the stained glass window, loosened a latch at the side of it, and pushed the whole thing so that it rested horizontally above Henry’s head. Henry had a clear view of his fans.</p>
				<p>“Say something,” Tom said.</p>
				<p>“What?”</p>
				<p>“Something about the man. Something bad.”</p>
				<p>“Who’s the man?”</p>
				<p>“Like the big man; society’s man.”</p>
				<p>Henry had read something about him. He fetched one of his books and recited. “The first man who fenced in a piece of land and said 'This is mine,' that man was the true founder of civil society. Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.”</p>
				<p>The crowd had stirred a little when one of them said, “Hey, it’s the golden voice guy.” But they looked bemused after his speech.</p>
				<p>“Uh, Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains.”</p>
				<p>The crowd answered, “Right on.” and “We don’t work though.”</p>
				<p>“Ok then. Tax the rich, feed the poor, ‘til there are no rich no more.”</p>
				<p>This got them riled up and howling.</p>
				<p>Henry looked at Tom, who said, “Something about them.”</p>
				<p>“I’d love to change the world, but I don’t know what to do. So I’ll leave it up to you.”</p>
				<p>They were chanting now, “Golden voice, golden voice, golden voice.”</p>
				<p>Tom slowly pushed the window back into place. “That was outta sight.”</p>
				<p>Henry was rocked to sleep by the chanting of his fans.</p>
				<h4>* * *</h4>
				<p>The next month was busy. They interviewed a panoply of officials, everything from police officers to politicians. The more serious the person tried to be, the more irreverent their response. Tom had plenty of notes on each guest, but there was no shortage to Henry’s rebuttals either; furthermore, they were more articulate. In between officials, they interviewed their fans; Henry let them do most of the talking. </p>
				<p>Henry was reading on the sofa when Tom came upstairs with a band of Henry’s fans and what Tom called groupies. Tom popped the cork of this huge bottle and pronounced: “Here’s to one month.” Before long the room was filled with smoke, the table with bottles; a flowerless vase was introduced as the centrepiece. Tom’s groupies were all over Henry. </p>
				<p>“You’re so handsome.” </p>
				<p>“And smart; look at all those books.” </p>
				<p>“Yes he is. Say something smart for us.” </p>
				<p>Henry said, “Men make their history, but they do not make it as they please.”</p>
				<p>“Groovy.”</p>
				<p>Richard popped his head up from the stairs. “Henry, there’s someone looking for you outside.”</p>
				<p> “Ok.” Henry walked to the window, unlatched it, and threw it open. “Hello.”</p>
				<p>It was his parents. When they saw him, his mother started sobbing, and his father started yelling. “Do you realize how much worry you have caused your mother? If you don’t come home right now, I will be furious.”</p>
				<p>“I don’t care.”</p>
				<p>A few people inside cheered. Tom leaned out the window. “That’s right, he doesn’t care. And even if he did want to go back with you, he’s signed a year-long contract with us.” He winked at Henry and stumbled back inside.</p>
				<p>“Is that right?” Mr Vogler said.</p>
				<p>“I’m not coming back,” Henry said.</p>
				<p>Mr Vogler led his wife into the Bentley. You could hear her sobbing for two blocks.</p>
				<h4>* * *</h4>
				<p>Henry woke up to the front door being slammed. He found Tom in the lobby, rubbing his forehead. “Hey, Henry. Turns out I had promised old Dick a break. It’s just gonna be us for a while.”</p>
				<p>Two weeks into Richard’s break, things were looking a little different. The control room was always filled with smoke and Tom kept wads of money on the table in there. He said it looked boss. Henry’s fans hung out inside the studio now; they wouldn’t go into his room, except for the occasional evening fun. But they were always in the recording room, even when Henry conducted his interviews. </p>
				<p>Henry was about to say, “That is an asinine propagation of a capitalist patriarchy,” for the seventh time that week, when he stopped himself. This gave his interviewee the chance to explain why the city needed animal shelters. Henry started talking less and less, until he almost exclusively answered with a simple “OK.”</p>
				<p>Two minutes into one of those interviews, Tom took them off the air and beckoned Henry into the control room.</p>
				<p>“Is everything alright, kid?”</p>
				<p>“Yes.”</p>
				<p>“I noticed you haven’t been saying much lately. Have I been overworking you?”</p>
				<p>Henry didn’t say anything.</p>
				<p>“Alright, you’re taking a vacation right now.” Tom sent the interviewee home and Henry to his room.</p>
				<p>Henry went to his room and stayed there for a week. Tom checked on him periodically, seeing if he was ready to work, but Henry had stopped talking entirely. He had forgotten how nice it was to be mute. Besides, he had everything a voice could bring him. Was it worth the effort? Tom’s pleas and anger didn’t change anything, and at the end of the week, in the middle of the night, Henry snuck into the control room, took all the money of the table in the control room and disappeared into the night.</p>
				<p>He had gotten the idea from a book. He took the late night bus up north, to whatever town sounded the most secluded; Brittia won out. There he bought a cabin from a certain Mr. Bartleby. Once Henry learned to work the land he never had to talk to anyone ever again.</p>
